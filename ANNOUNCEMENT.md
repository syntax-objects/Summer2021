# Syntax Parse Bee 2021

Hi folks,

**Write a macro with Racket this summer! Win stickers!**

The purpose of this event is to grow the [syntax-parse-example](https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax-parse-example/index.html) [documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax-parse-example/index.html) and [repository](https://github.com/bennn/syntax-parse-example) to grow as a resource for the Racket community. (You can also contribute directly to the [syntax parse examples repository](https://github.com/bennn/syntax-parse-example))

_It's like a Quilting Bee, but for syntax parse macros!_

As we hope to include many new examples derived from the entries in the syntax-parse-example [documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax-parse-example/index.html) and [repository](https://github.com/bennn/syntax-parse-example) we ask entrants to licence their code under the same MIT license [1] as used by Racket, and your text under the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ license.

Ground Rules:
* you can write any macro as long as it uses [syntax-parse](https://docs.racket-lang.org/syntax/stxparse.html) somehow
* enter as many times as you like
* the first 20 individuals who enter will win exclusive stickers
* open July 1 to September 1

Submit by opening an issue here: [submit your entry](https://github.com/syntax-objects/Summer2021/issues/new?assignees=&labels=entry&template=enter-the-syntax-parse-bee.md&title=%5Bentry+-+name%2Fdescription+of+macro%5D)

To help you get started, we suggest two categories of before-and-after macro:

1. Code Cleaning : Introduce a macro where there was none before. Look for ways
   to make your source code more beautiful and/or less repetitive.

2. Macro Engineering : Use the tools in syntax-parse to improve an existing
   macro (which may or may not currently use syntax-parse). Try to make the old
   macro more maintainable, more robust against errors, and/or more flexible.

Updates will be via Racket News, Racket-Users, Slack, Discord & Reddit.

Whatever you decide, we hope that you learn and have fun!

PS a 'Bee' is a community effort toward a common goal. A quilting bee is for
making a quilt. In this case the quilt is a patchwork of syntax-parse macros.
